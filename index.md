## Big Title 1

Follow these instructions to build the theme.

### 1. Sub Title 1

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum..

In case you haven't installed Bundler, install it:

```
gem install bundler
```

You'll want [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) to make sure all the Ruby gems needed work well with your project. Bundler sorts out dependencies and installs missing gems or matches up gems with the right versions based on gem dependencies.

## Big Title 2

You can also use Docker to directly build and run the site on your local machine. Just clone the repo and run the following from your working dir:
```
docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up
```
The site should now be running at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).

This is perhaps the easiest way to see how your site would actually look.
